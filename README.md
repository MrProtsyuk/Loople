## User Story
I want an application where I can search top results on topics and people I am interested in without using a host of different websites or having to go through a bunch of links on Google. Loople is an interactive webpage that allows a user to search a topic and be given a response on the latest news, videos, and in the future, social media posts.

## Requirements
* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two server-side APIs.

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals). //Unfortunatly we were unable to do this.

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Technologies Used
Foundation for the CSS frame work

Youtube API and TheNewsAPI for our server side APIs
